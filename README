getCPANELbackups.sh is a useful script for saving your backups (home directory
and databases) from a web server which has cPanel installed and configured. Even
if the majority of hosting providers offer you means to backup your files and
some of them do keep these, from time to time they delete them in order to save
space.

What happens if your web-site got hacked and the only backup with your clean
files was removed?

This script offers you an automated mode of getting your backups from your
web server. By calling it from a CRON job, you can rest assured that you
*always* are in charge of your backups.

Usage instructions:
================================================================================
getCPANELbackups.sh needs several configuration files in order to work:

1.	Main configuration file - getCPANELbackups.conf (global settings)
	- for details on configuration check the supplied file

2.	Domain configuration files (one for every domain). See the example.com file
	included in the package. Every domain configuration file should be named
	like the domain it is used for without any other extension (e.g. foo.com,
	bar.com).

After the aforementioned files have been created you can run the script manually
or set it as part of a CRON job, e.g.:
00 00 * * * /home/user/bin/getCPANELbackups.sh

The CRON job from above will run the script every day at 00:00.

Security:
================================================================================
Because your domain configuration files contain sensible data (username,
password) it's better to keep them as private as possible. This means 0600
file permissions so that no user besides you has access to them.

Furthermore, be careful not to make them public by accident.
